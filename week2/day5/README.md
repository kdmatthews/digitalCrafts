<!-- In this Python Game all you have to do is run the code and begin the adventure!

You will start off by choosing the hero you would like to play as. You can pick between the adorable Grogu and the mighty Mandolorian. Playing as Grogu will be an easier, shorter adventure journey. For those brave travelers looking for a challenge playing as Mando is the way to go!

Be sure to monitor your health and attack while playing and I wish you the best of luck!
May the Force be with you!
