# CSS Flexbox

- What is flexbox?????
- Pros: Simple and very short to get your desired effect
        works really well with multiple columns
- Cons: I don't like the syntax, it can be tricky to understand.
- Cons: Single column layouts are more challenging for it to work.

- `display: flex` organizes everything by default from left to right
